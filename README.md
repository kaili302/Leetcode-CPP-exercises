I used Java for more than 4 years. 
After joining Amadeus, my principal programming language is swithed to C++ (and some C). I begin to like C++ more than ever.

After work, besides reading C++ tutorials, I'm also praticing my C++ skills by resolving all these algorithms problems from Leetcode. Playing with C++ container classes and pointer, I find this really help to pratice and understand C++.
